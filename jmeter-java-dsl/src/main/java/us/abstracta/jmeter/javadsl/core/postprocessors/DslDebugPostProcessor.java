/**
 * Adds a sub result to a given sampler result, including jmeter variables, jmeter properties, etc.,
 * which are handy when debugging test plans.
 * <p>
 * This element is particularly helpful when debugging extractors, since it allows checking
 * generated JMeter variables.
 * <p>
 * This element by default will only include JMeter variables in sub sample response body, which
 * differs from JMeter default configuration, since is the most used scenario and avoids unnecessary
 * memory or disk usage.
 * <p>
 * In general use IDE debugger in first steps of debugging a test plan using a thread group
 * configuration with only 1 thread. If you need to get more information on a test plan with
 * multiple threads during or after test plan execution, then use this element, in combination with
 * <pre>resultsTreeVisualizer</pre> or <pre>jtlWriter</pre> saving sub results and response bodies
 * in xml format, avoiding stopping in each thread break point and avoid affecting the performance
 * test metrics.
